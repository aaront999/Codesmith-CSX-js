# Codesmith CSX JavaScript Coding Challenges.

#### This repository showcases my JavaScript experience through the completion of 115 coding challenges on the Codesmith CSX platform. While I can't list all 115 challenges, I have highlighted a selection spanning various topics I have personally covered, which include: JavaScript Fundamentals (Parts 1 & 2), Functions and Execution Context, Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions, Closures, Scope and Execution Context, and Object-Oriented Programming.

#### NOTE: Full code implementations cannot be fully displayed via screenshots. However, I have conveniently linked each full code repository to its corresponding challenge for detailed review.
